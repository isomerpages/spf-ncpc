<p>NCPC&nbsp;worked with SPF and&nbsp;MHA&nbsp;to develop #XiamTheScams,
a web-based life-simulation game,&nbsp;which ran from 24 October 2024 to
22 January 2025.</p>

<p>Over three months, the game achieved&nbsp;a&nbsp;participation of over
519,000 players, completion of over 10 million gameplay scenarios, and
adoption of more than 77,000 protec</p>
<p>tive anti-scam actions (e.g. downloads of ScamShield app and subscriptions

<p>On 22 February 2025, the top 10 players of the #XiamTheScams game&nbsp;received
their&nbsp;prizes&nbsp;at the NCPC Crime Prevention Roadshow 2025. The
event was&nbsp;graced by Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs &amp;
Ministry of Social and Family Development Ms Sun Xueling.&nbsp;We are also
pleased to share that local celebrity, Mr Jack Neo, was appointed as NCPCâ€™s
Honorary Crime Prevention Ambassador on the same day.&nbsp;In total, 10,000
people visited the roadshow over two days.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Background of the #XiamTheScams game</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The #XiamTheScams game&nbsp;was developed&nbsp;to&nbsp;enhance awareness
of common scam types and encourage adoption of anti-scam protective measures
among the public through an experiential approach.&nbsp;Players&nbsp;were
exposed to a series of both scam and legitimate situations mimicking common
everyday routine activities and situations, and were prompted to make choices
that rely on their familiarity with common scam signs and protective anti-scam
measures.</p>
