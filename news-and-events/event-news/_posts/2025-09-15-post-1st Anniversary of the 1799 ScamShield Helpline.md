<p>Since its rebranding in September 2024, the ScamShield Helpline has become
a key resource for the public. With a shorter number (1799) and extended <strong>24/7 operating hours</strong>,
the helpline provides real-time support for scam-related queries. In just
one year, it has handled over <strong>128,000 calls and online chats</strong>,
with daily call volumes now reaching between <strong>500 and 700</strong>.
About 80% of callers sought verification on whether situations they encountered
were scams.</p>
<p></p>
<p>NCPC encourages the public to continue calling the ScamShield Helpline
at <strong>1799</strong> whenever they are unsure if something could be a
scam. Stakeholders also play a vital role in curbing the rise in scam cases.
Platform owners, in particular, can help raise awareness among their users
and implement creative solutions to strengthen their systems against criminals
who will stop at nothing to exploit victims.</p>
