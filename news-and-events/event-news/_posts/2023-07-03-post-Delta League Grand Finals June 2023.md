The Delta League tournament, organized jointly by the NCPC and Police, kicked off in May 2023 with the Grand Finals held on Saturday, 24 June 2023, at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Ms. Sun Xueling, Minister of State for the Ministry of Home Affairs &amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development, graced the event as the Guest of Honour. In this edition, close to 1,000 youths aged between 13 and 17, forming a total of 129 teams, showcased their talents and skills in the football/e-gaming events. Both events demanded participants to possess exceptional tactical abilities, effective planning, adaptability, and good teamwork.

Over the month-long programme, the young participants immersed themselves in various activities aimed at promoting awareness of crime prevention as well as to instil a sense of social responsibility, teamwork, and discipline. Departing from the conventional lecture-based Youth Workshop, this year’s Delta League started with an Amazing Race at the Singapore SportsHub on 29 May 2023. This new approach exposed the youths to team-building and crime prevention education in a fresh and exciting manner. As part of the Community Day activities, the youths were also brought to the Police Community Road Shows at both Punggol and Toa Payoh. They were there with their Police Mentors to disseminate crime prevention advisories to members of the public.

See you at the next edition in December 2023!
