<p>Delta Challenge 2025 – Art Against Scams is an initiative by the National
Crime Prevention Council and the Singapore Police Force to engage youths
through creativity and community action. Participants design murals to
raise awareness about scams and promote the 24/7 ScamShield Helpline (1799).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Winning artworks are transformed into public murals across Singapore,
turning everyday spaces into powerful reminders to stay vigilant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Delta Challenge empowers our youth to take an active role in keeping
Singapore safe from scams. Beyond tapping into the youths’ creativity and
digital savviness, the Delta Challenge also aims to deepen collaboration
between NCPC, the Police, and the youths.</p>

<p>The top 10 participants brought their mural designs to life by painting
them on walls across Singapore, transforming everyday public spaces into
vibrant canvases of creativity and awareness. In collaboration with PAssionArts,
members of the community joined in to paint these meaningful artworks,
creating moments of shared purpose and connection.</p>
