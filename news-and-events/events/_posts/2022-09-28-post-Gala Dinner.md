The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) celebrated its 40th anniversary at its Gala Dinner on 28 September 2022 at Marina Bay Sands. More than 400 guests consisting of donors, corporate partners and community stakeholders were in attendance to celebrate this joyous milestone.

The Android version of the ScamShield app was also launched during that evening. ScamShield identifies and filters out scam SMSes and blocks calls from blacklisted numbers that have been verified as scam-related. These unique features reduce the opportunities for scammers to reach out to intended victims. In addition, the app enables users to report scam messages and receive alerts on trending scams.

Chairman NCPC Mr Gerald Singham, said, “While unthinkable four decades ago, the majority of crimes today are taking place in cyberspace. NCPC must continue to innovate and remain relevant, as crimes, especially scams, are evolving all the time. We are glad to have strategic partners like Open Government Products to develop ScamShield to help protect Singaporeans against scam SMSes and calls.”

Since the launch, the app has been downloaded by more than 450,000 users on both the iOS and Android platforms. About 6.5 million SMSes have been flagged to users as potential scams while about 12,900 unique scam-tainted phone numbers have been blacklisted and blocked.

The 40th anniversary gala dinner raised more than $700,000 from generous corporate and individual donors to support NCPC’s programmes. The Council is committed to play a key role to serve the community so that Singapore can continue to be a safe and secure place for all
