The National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) jointly organised the Delta League (DL) December 2022 Edition tournament this year from 25 November 2022 to 22 December 2022. Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs &amp; Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling, graced the Grand Finals as the Guest of Honour (GOH). The event was held on Thursday, 22 December 2022, at Our Tampines Hub.

A total of 168 teams, formed by more than 1,200 youths aged between 13 and 17, pitted their wits and skills over either football or e-gaming. Ninety (90) teams participated in the football tournament under three different categories – Category 1: Boys 13-14yrs, Category 2: Boys 15-17yrs and Girls’ Open Category. In the e-gaming tournament, seventy-eight (78) teams competed in the Mobile Legends: Bang-Bang (MLBB) game under the Open Category (13-17yrs). Both formats demand strong tactical abilities, planning, adaptation, and teamwork from all the participants.

Besides their participation in the football and e-gaming competitions, the youths were also involved in different fun-filled activities to enhance their crime prevention awareness as well as inculcate a sense of social responsibility, teamwork, and discipline. The Youth Workshop was held at the Kreta Ayer People’s Theatre on 25 November 2022. Two key issues were pre-identified to engage these young participants: Staying Away from Gangs and Anti-Scam Awareness. During the workshop, sharing sessions were conducted with the youths on gang issues, scam awareness, good cybersecurity practices and soccer tactics. During the Community Day, participants also went out onto the streets with their Police mentors to share crime prevention materials, tips with members of the public and encourage them to download the ScamShield App.

We would like to thank all participants, sponsors and partners for the strong support! See you at the next edition.
