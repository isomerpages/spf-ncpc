Since 1981, the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), a non-profit organisation committed to rallying crime prevention efforts and awareness in Singapore, has been carrying out public education activities and series of initiatives to raise public vigilance against crime; NCPC also strongly advocates active citizenry in the fight against crime.

Crime prevention is a shared responsibility for everyone and NCPC seeks your generous contributions to support the cause of crime prevention! No amount of contribution is too small for our cause and every dollar of your contribution will go a long way towards making your home and nation safer and more secure for all.

We also accord strong recognition to all our valued donors - “Platinum Donors”, “Gold Donors” and Silver Donors”.
