#### <font style="color:#a20427;">MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN</font>

![](/images/About/header-border.png)

2022 was a memorable year as the National Crime
Prevention Council held its belated 40th Anniversary
Gala Dinner at the Marina Bay Sands. We had to postpone
the event from 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I was
delighted to finally meet all the donors, stakeholders
and supporters in person to commemorate a most
joyous milestone.

NCPC was founded on 4 July 1981. Inaugurating the
Council at the Hyatt Hotel, then Home Affairs Minister
Mr Chua Sian Chin said the Council was an experiment
in seeing if Singaporeans could be persuaded to
accept measures not through force of law, but through
persuasion based on the merits of the case. Preventable
physical crimes like robbery, housebreaking and theft
were rampant in the 1980s. Since then, Singaporeans
have met the call not to do things only when forced,
but to appreciate that crime prevention is a shared
responsibility.

NCPC’s vision and mission still remains the same but
the mode and type of crimes we face now are vastly
different. Unthinkable four decades ago, crimes today
are mostly taking place in cyberspace. In 2022, the
number of scams and cybercrime cases in Singapore
increased by 25.2% to 33,669 cases. As you may
already know, the increase was again due to more
scams reported by victims. The total number of scam
cases shot up by 32.6% to 31,728 in 2022, from
23,933 cases in 2021. Sadly, the total amount cheated
by scams jumped to $660.7 million in 2022 alone. In just
two years from 2021 to 2022, Singaporeans lost close
to $1.3 billion to scammers.

Collaborating with the police, private sector and the
community, NCPC continued to devote much of its
resources to fighting scams. The “I Can ACT Against
Scams” campaign was launched to encourage
everyone to proactively adopt anti-scam measures.
The ScamShield mobile app, rolled out in November
2020, has been downloaded by close to 600,000
users. More than 7.4 million SMSes have been reported
as potential scams, and more than 70,000 blacklisted
phone numbers have been blocked by ScamShield
to reduce opportunities for scammers to reach out to
potential victims.

NCPC will press on to seek the support of our
stakeholders to continue our fight against crime and
keep Singapore safe. Last but definitely not the least,
I would like to pay tribute to my fellow Council members,
past and present – it is my privilege to be part of this
great team. Thank you for your commitment, dedication
and service to the nation!
