In 2023, while the total number of physical crime cases
dropped by 1.1%, scams and cybercrime cases increased
significantly by 49.6%. Singapore continued to be a safe
and secure city for everyone but the cyberspace still
continues to be a concern.

There were 277 days last year which were free from
robbery, snatch theft and theft of motor vehicle. Compared
to the 241 days in 2022, it was an improvement of 36
days. The top physical crimes included shop theft, theft
in dwelling, outrage of modesty and voyeurism. Shop
theft alone accounted for 19.7% of all physical crimes.
More than 68% of the cases took place at department
stores, supermarkets and pharmacies.

Although the number of outrage of modesty (OM) cases
fell to 1,528 in 2023 (from 1,610 in 2022), NCPC continued
to work with SPF and stakeholders to educate the public
on the preventive measures. In January 2024, the fourth
edition of the Safe Clubbing Campaign (formerly known
as Smart Clubbing Campaign) was kicked off. It was
strongly supported by the Singapore Nightlife Business
Association and Singapore River One to foster a safe
environment for patrons and staff of public entertainment
outlets. NCPC has also been working with public
transport operators to put up educational posters on OM
at train stations, bus interchanges and on MRT trains.

The number of scams and cybercrime cases increased
to 50,376 in 2023, compared to 33,669 cases the year
before. There was a slight decrease in the total amount
lost by victims, from $660.7 million to $651.8 million.
Unfortunately, that was still a very large sum of money
being cheated in a year.

The top five scam types were job scams, e-commerce
scams, fake friend call scams, phishing scams and
investment scams. NCPC’s “I can ACT against Scams”
campaign continued to educate Singaporeans on the
common ways to protect themselves from scams. A
new music video on ACT garnered more than one million
views on social and digital platforms. Through a survey
conducted in 2023, we were glad to find out that 79% of
the 1,000 respondents recalled seeing at least one of our
campaign posters. In addition, 78% were able to recall
the messages under the ACT campaign. Meanwhile, the
ScamShield app achieved more than 850,000 downloads
and users submitted over 7.9 million suspected SMSes.
Each report made by the ScamShield user helped to
enhance the app’s detection capability, thus preventing
scammers from reaching more victims.

As can be seen, each and everyone of us can play a
crucial role to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.
Indeed, crime prevention is a Shared Responsibility! Last
but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to all
the community partners, stakeholders and sponsors for
contributing to the success of NCPC’s crime prevention
programmes in 2023.
