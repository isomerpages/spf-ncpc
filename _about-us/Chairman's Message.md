The National Crime Prevention Council was established in 1981 to change mindsets and work in close partnership with the police and community to prevent crime. 2021 was a most significant year indeed, as we commemorated the Council’s 40th Anniversary and faced unprecedented challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

As Singaporeans stayed at home and engaged in more online activities, criminals adapted quickly and launched waves after waves of scam ‘attacks’. As a result, there was a 52.9% jump in scam cases in 2021, lifting the total number of reported crimes to 46,196 cases, from 37,273 cases in 2020. If scams and cybercrimes were excluded, the total number of crimes in 2021 actually fell by 1% to 19,303 cases.

The most prevalent scams in 2021 were job scams, nonbanking related phishing scams, e-commerce scams, investment scams, and loan scams. Many Singaporeans fell for job scams due to the economic recession. The number of such scams shot up to 4,554 in 2021, from just 132 cases in 2020. According to police records, one victim lost as much as $4.3 million to a job scam last year. In total, the amount cheated for the top 10 scam types increased to $504.4 million in 2021, from $175.2 million in 2020.

Collaborating with the police and stakeholders, the Council continued to step up its fight against scams. Our ScamShield mobile app, launched in late 2020, has picked up more than four million SMSes and calls as potential scams, and blocked more than 15,000 phone numbers from making calls to the app users. Last year, our anti-scam helpline (1800-722-6688) handled more than 6,500 calls from people seeking advice on scams. NCPC’s CrimeWatch, one of the most popular TV shows in Singapore, has a special “Scam Alert” segment on every episode to feature current scams and provide relevant advisories.

The role of the Council has evolved over the past four decades. The pervasiveness of the internet and social media has changed the way we live and will certainly bring about more challenges in the area of crime prevention. For 40 years, NCPC has partnered tirelessly with the Singapore Police Force and the community to build a safe and secure society. We will press on to seek the support of our stakeholders to tackle crime in an ever-changing security landscape. The meaningful work of the Council is always never-ending and we hope to benefit everyone in Singapore for more years to come.

Happy 40th Anniversary, NCPC!
