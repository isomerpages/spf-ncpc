<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>In September 2002, the NCPC collaborated with the Ministry of Community
Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and SPF to initiate the Crime Prevention
Ambassadors (CPA) programme. This was expanded to include the CPA in May
2024.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Crime Prevention Ambassador</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this programme, senior citizens are appointed as CPAs to work in
partnership with the Police and grassroots organizations, to educate their
fellow senior citizens on crime prevention measures.</p>
<p>To date, there are over 200 trained CPAs who speak the four main languages
and common Chinese dialects to disseminate crime prevention messages to
the elderly. Being contemporaries, there is a sense of ease of sharing
their experiences and crime prevention concerns between the CPAs and the
participants.</p>
<p>This successful initiative not only reaches out to the elderly and their
families, but also provides an avenue to integrate senior citizens back
into society as active volunteers after their retirement from the work
force.</p>
<p>The role of the CPA is to assist NCPC to: • conduct chit chat sessions
with senior citizens at RCs, CCs, etc; • conduct training sessions with
police officers; and • conduct crime prevention talk/exhibition in schools
and various organisations.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h5>Cyber Crime Prevention Ambassador</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2024, the CPA programme expanded to include Cyber Crime Prevention
Ambassadors. This new role focuses on educating the community about cybercrime
prevention through workshops, seminars, and public talks. Cyber CPAs will
support relevant stakeholders and cybersecurity experts, to galvanise the
community to take a more proactive role in safeguarding our cyberspace.</p>
