##### <font style="color:#a20427;">INTRODUCTION</font>

In September 2002, the National Crime Prevention Council, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and SPF, initiated the Crime Prevention Ambassadors (CPA) programme. Under this programmes, senior citizens are appointed as CPAs to work in partnership with the Police and grassroots organizations, to educate their fellow senior citizens on crime prevention measures. 

To date, there are over 190 trained CPAs who speak the 4 main languages and common Chinese dialects to disseminate crime prevention messages to the elderly. Being contemporaries, there is a sense of ease of sharing their experiences and crime prevention concerns between the CPAs and the participants.

The successful project not only reaches out to the elderly and their families, but also provides an avenue to integrate senior citizens back into society as active volunteers after their retirement from the work force.

The role of CPA is to assist our officers to:

*   conduct chit chat sessions with senior citizens at RCs, CCs, etc;
*   conduct training session with NWZ Liaison Officers; and
*   conduct crime prevention talk/exhibition in schools.
