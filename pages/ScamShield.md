#### <font style="color:#a20427">About ScamShield</font>

###### <font style="color:#a20427">More than 600,000 people have downloaded the ScamShield App to block scam SMSes and calls.</font>

[ScamShield](https://www.scamshield.org.sg/), a new mobile app, has been launched to fight scam messages and calls which plague mobile phone users. Developed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), in collaboration with Open Government Products (OGP), a division of the Government Technology Agency and the Singapore Police Force, the app was launched on 20 November 2020 by Mr Desmond Tan, Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.  

#### <font style="color:#a20427">Blocking of Scam Messages and Calls</font>
###### <font style="color:#a20427">More than 7 million suspicious SMSes have been reported as scams. Calls from more than 70,000 blacklisted phone numbers have been blocked by the ScamShield app</font>

ScamShield actively works in the background to filter scam messages and calls from numbers used in illegal activities. This will greatly reduce the prospect of people being contacted by scammers. Only incoming SMSes from unknown contacts go through ScamShield. Scam messages are filtered and sent into the phone's junk folder. Only identified scam messages and numbers will be blocked. Calls from these blocked numbers will not be shown to ScamShield users.  

#### <font style="color:#a20427">Privacy Safeguards</font>
ScamShield does not have any access to data from people in your contact list. Only messages sent by unknown numbers will be read by your device, and only those identified as scam will be sent to NCPC for collation. ScamShield also does not have any access to your location or any personal data. The app does not require users to register with their mobile phone number and hence will not be able to identify any users.
