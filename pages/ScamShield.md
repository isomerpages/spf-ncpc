<h3><strong>Your privacy is our priority</strong></h3>
<p>We value and respect your privacy, and follow the strictest measures to
keep your information safe and confidential when you use ScamShield products.
<br>
<br>The App cannot read any SMSes you receive from contacts saved on your
phone. It only scans SMSes from unfamiliar numbers to look for any known
signs of scams.
<br>
<br>When you submit a scam encounter via the ScamShield app, the authorities
can only see the information you have submitted and not any personal information.</p>
