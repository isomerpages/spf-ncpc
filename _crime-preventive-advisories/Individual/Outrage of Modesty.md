PREVENTIVE MEASURES

Preventive Measures

*   Be aware of your surroundings and stay alert to any suspicious person(s);
*   Avoid walking through dimly lit, quiet and secluded places;
*   When returning home alone or late at night, arrange for a family member or trusted friend to escort you home; and
*   If you suspect that you are being followed, remain calm. Proceed to a crowded area or call the Police for assistance.


If you are taking the lift

*   Whenever possible, avoid taking the lift with suspicious person(s),if alone; and
*   When entering the lift alone, stay close to the lift button panel. Press "Door Open" and step out immediately when a suspicious person(s) rushes in as the lift door is closing.
*   Carry along with you a shrill alarm

 
If you are taking the public transport

*   Be alert and attentive to your surroundings. When possible, move away if someone stands or sits exceptionally close to you;
*   If you are molested, call for help immediately by shouting, seek help from people nearby or activate a shrill alarm to increase the chances of apprehending the culprit early. Call ‘999’ as soon as possible; and
*   Approach the station manager or contact Police for assistance if you see any suspicious looking passenger.

 
For young children

*   Young children should be accompanied home at all times. Ensure that your young ones do not wander in public places alone without adult supervision; and
*   Remind your young ones not to talk to strangers.

If you are confronted by a molester, stay calm and take note of his/her appearance, attire, height, or any other distinctive physical features. Call the Police as soon as possible so that our officers can reach the location quickly to assist you.
