In Homes

How It Can Happen:

* Entering or forcing through unsecured doors or other entrances.
* Waiting for the victim to enter or leave the premises and then forcing his way in together with the victim.
* Impersonating as a public servant or door-to-door salesman.
* Entering the premises on the pretext of delivering goods or hampers, using the toilet or telephone, and viewing the premises in response to a newspaper advertisement for rental or sale.

Preventive Measures:

* Padlock the grille gates so that the culprit cannot rush or force his way in when the door is opened. Always deal with strangers through a locked grille gate.
* Never open doors to strangers. Use the door viewer to have a good look at the stranger. Talk to the stranger with a chain latch/door limiter fastened if it is available.
* Verify the identity of anyone who claims to be a public servant, door-to-door salesman or representative from other organisations. Call his organisation through the number obtained from your telephone directory. Do not rely on the number that he gives you.
* Inform family members in advance if someone unknown is being sent to the house. Call the Police at "999" if in doubt.

In Lifts/Streets

How It Can Happen:

* Loitering at lift landings or void decks to ambush the victim while he or she is waiting to take the lift.
* Entering the lift as the lift door is closing and robbing the victim when he or she is confined in it.
* Luring the victim by claiming to be a relative or friend, before bringing them to a secluded place to rob them of their valuables.
* Accusing victims of staring, causing annoyance, or starting a quarrel, before bringing them to a secluded place to rob them of their valuables.
* Using the pretext of asking for road directions, time, assistance, and taking the opportunity to rob you.
* Directing your attention to stains or dirt (such as ketchup or ice-cream stains) on your clothes and taking the opportunity to rob you.

Preventive Measures in the Streets:

* Avoid wearing lots of jewellery and carrying large sums of cash;
* Do not show your cash or valuables in public;
* Avoid walking through dimly lit, quiet and secluded places;
* Carry a shrill alarm to sound for help;\When returning home alone or late at night, arrange for a family member or trusted friend to escort you home; and
* If you suspect that you are being followed, remain calm. Proceed to a crowded area or call the Police for assistance.

Preventive Measures in the Lift:

* Avoid taking the lift with a stranger. Let the stranger take the lift and wait for the next one; and
* When entering the lift alone, stay close to the lift button panel. Press “Door Open” and step out immediately when a stranger rushes in as the lift door is closing.

If you are confronted by a thief, stay calm and take note of his or her appearance, attire, height, or any other distinctive physical features if possible. Call the Police as soon as possible so that our officers can reach the location quickly to assist you.
