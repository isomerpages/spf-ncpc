##### <font style="color:#a20427;">HOW IT CAN HAPPEN </font>

*   Items were usually stolen by culprits when no one was looking at them.
*   Culprits either operate alone or in groups of two to three persons with one subject distracting the staff while the remaining person(s) steal items on display.
*   Culprits tend to try on items such as belts, clothes and accessories before concealing the items under their clothes or simply leaving without taking them off.
*   Culprits tend to make payments only for some of the items in the shopping basket and the other items were taken without paying.
