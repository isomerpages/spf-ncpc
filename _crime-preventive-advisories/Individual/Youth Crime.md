HOW IT CAN HAPPEN

Involvement in Gangs

The most common crime committed by youths is shop theft. Youths are also involved in violent crimes such as murder, rioting, extortion and unlawful assembly.

Besides committing offences like shoplifting, extortion, etc, youths can also become involved in gangs. This can lead to serious and tragic consequences, such as becoming victims of rival gang clashes.

Most problem youths come from homes lacking in parental guidance and are usually under-achievers in schools and with low self-esteem.<br><br>

ABOUT GANG INVOLVEMENT

Common Misperception I

I am not a gang member. I have never paid entrance fees or monthly subscription fees to join a gang. In fact, I was invited to join for free but I turned down the offer because I only wanted to associate with the gang members. As such, I have nothing to worry about!

Facts

You are regarded as a gang member as long as you know that your friends are members of the gang and you continue to join them in their gang activities. Even if you deny, your friends will still say you belong to their gang. Such gang activities are:

* Gathering at the gang's operational ground.
* Recruiting or introducing new members to the gang.
* Accompanying gang members in outings.
* Being present with gang members during:
* Staring incidents.\Settlements talks.
* Fights.
* Search of rival gang members to seek revenge.
* Funeral wake and procession of gang member or his relative, etc.
 

Common Misperception II

I followed my friends to attend a talk to settle a dispute with rival gang members because I was curious. During the settlement talk, I stood a short distance away and did not hear what was discussed. The Police cannot arrest me because I have not committed any offence.<br><br>

* Staring incidents.
