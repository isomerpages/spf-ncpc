How if can happen

Heard of trade secrets?

* Businesses, companies and organisations have them. Well, so do pickpockets! Here are some of their secrets and police advice on how to avoid becoming a victim. Pickpockets target at people in crowds who carry cash in public.
* Do not display excessive cash in the public as this might draw unnecessary attention, instead use NETS & ATM cards for cashless transactions where possible.
* Pickpockets deliberately bump into an unsuspecting person in a crowd. Check your wallets, handbag and valuables immediately if someone bumps into you unnecessarily. They create a commotion in public to distract everybody's attention while picking on pockets.
* Be on guard and alert for various scams and confidence trickster that would take place while you are doing banking at an ATM or after a transaction out from the bank.
* Do not doze off in the bus or MRT train and leave your belongings unattended.
* Do not be distracted by strangers creating a commotion or accidentally spilling something on you. Be wary of such situations.

Preventive measures
