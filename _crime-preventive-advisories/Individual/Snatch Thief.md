* Carry your sling bag in front of you, or clasp it firmly under your arm;
* Avoid walking through dimly lit, quiet and secluded places;
* Carry a shrill alarm to sound for help;
* When returning home alone or late at night, arrange for a family member or trusted friend to escort you home; and

IF YOU ARE TAKING THE LIFT

* Avoid taking the lift with a stranger. Let the stranger take the lift and wait for the next one; and
* When entering the lift alone, stay close to the lift button panel. Press “Door Open” and step out immediately when a stranger rushes in as the lift door is closing.
* If you are confronted by a thief, stay calm and take note of his or her appearance, attire, height, or any other distinctive physical features if possible. 
* Call the Police as soon as possible so that our officers can reach the location quickly to assist you.
