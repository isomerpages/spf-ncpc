**What is Cybercrime?**  

Cybercrime are criminal acts related to the use of computers such as:

*   Gaining unauthorised access to computer to view, modify or destroy its data.
*   Committing crime committed using the internet as a medium (e.g. sexual offences such as molest or date-rape; extortion; drug-peddling; disposal of stolen property; online auction fraud; and child pornography).  
    There are individuals waiting for opportunities to gain unauthorised access to your computer for their own ends. They might even make use of your computer to commit crime without your knowledge
*   E-shopping or online shopping may be convenient and effortless. But there are syndicates or individuals, who are out to steal credit card numbers or information on personal identity.
*   **"Get-rich-quick"**&nbsp;investment proposals are another ruse through e-mail to lure potential victims. For example, certain individuals may claim to be high-ranking government officials or royalty. They may approach you to transfer 'huge sum of excess government funds' out of foreign countries to earn 'huge commissions' in return. Accepting such offer will cause you to lose large sum of money as there are likely to be scams.
