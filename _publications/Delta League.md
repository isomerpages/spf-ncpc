The Delta League Book, produced in 2013 by the Singapore Police Force and National Crime Prevention Council, were given to sponsors, schools and working partners.

The Delta League, introduced in June 2011 by the Singapore Police Force, has helped over 1,000 teenagers from various backgrounds islandwide, providing them with a sporting platform to keep them away from crime-related activities.

This book chronicles how the League began, and how it rapidly expanded over its first two years, and the strong partnership between the Singapore Police Force and the National Crime Prevention Council. Through the twice-yearly football tournament as well as specially designed programmes – including mentoring, community-involvement activities and even free tattoo-removal services – the League helps youths realise that they can do more with their lives.
