##### <font style="color:#a20427;">BACKGROUND OF DELTA LEAGUE</font>

The Delta League is a youth outreach and engagement programme jointly organized by the [Background of Delta League](https://www.spf.gov.sg) and the [National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC)](https://www.ncpc.org.sg) during the June and December school holidays to keep the youths meaningfully occupied through football, raise their crime prevention awareness and the consequence of being involved in crime. Next year, we are celebrating the 10th Anniversary of Delta League.

Delta League is truly unique as it is not just a sports tournament. Using football as the key platform of engagement, Delta League draws the youths into a series of self-improvement and crime awareness activities. Beyond the football matches, the youths are given opportunity to interact with Police officers and life coaches, as well as to take part in satellite community and crime prevention activities. The youths will also learn about crime prevention and the consequences of crime and can showcase their creativity and design skills by designing crime prevention materials.

The aim of this unique programme is clear and simple – to work with community partners to dissuade youths from getting involved in crime by engaging them during the entire school holiday period. This is achieved by harnessing the energy of the youths through football and healthy activities that help steer them away from crime and mischief, and at the same time develop their sense of social responsibility. Throughout the process, opportunities and guidance are provided to encourage their personal development.

The Delta League was so named because it originated in Clementi Police Division, whose call sign is "Delta Division". Delta (Δ) is also used a symbol in mathematics and the sciences to represent "difference" or "change" – aptly encapsulating the League's mission of changing the lives of youths through football.

**Delta League – Changing Lives Through Football**

The Delta League Book, produced in 2013 by the Singapore Police Force and National Crime Prevention Council, were given to sponsors, schools and working partners.

The Delta League, introduced in June 2011 by the Singapore Police Force, has helped over 1,000 teenagers from various backgrounds islandwide, providing them with a sporting platform to keep them away from crime-related activities.

This book chronicles how the League began, and how it rapidly expanded over its first two years, and the strong partnership between the Singapore Police Force and the National Crime Prevention Council. Through the twice-yearly football tournament as well as specially designed programmes – including mentoring, community-involvement activities and even free tattoo-removal services – the League helps youths realise that they can do more with their lives.
