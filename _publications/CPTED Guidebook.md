The Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) Guidebook were produced and given out to stakeholders, architects and developers in 2003.

The purpose of this guidebook is to raise awareness of homeowners, developers, architects, and town planners on the concepts and principles of CPTED. CPTED seeks to enhance the safety of developments and minimise the opportunities for crime to be committed. This guidebook which was launched in conjunction with Safety and Security Asia 2003, aimed to generate a heightened sense of understanding towards the relationship between crime prevention and the physical environment.

Notwithstanding the relevance and usefulness of CPTED, the recommendations in this guidebook may not be compatible with the requirements, standards and codes of various relevant authorities. In such situations, the demands of the authorities will take precedence over the recommendations in this guidebook.
