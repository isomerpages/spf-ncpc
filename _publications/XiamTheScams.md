<p>#XiamTheScams challenged players to join the fight against scams in a
fun, life simulation web game that tested decision-making skills while
teaching how to avoid scams.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, over 519,000 players participated, adopting more than
76,000 real-life anti-scam measures. Players took steps such as downloading
the ScamShield App, subscribing to ScamShield Alert channels, and visiting
the ScamShield website, learning practical ways to stay scam-smart.</p>
<p>The game also offered over $55,000 in cash prizes and up to 3,000 gifts,
rewarding players for playing smart.</p>
<p>Due to <strong>YOUR participation and support for #XiamTheScams</strong>,
the game clinched multiple awards at different awards ceremonies, recognising
