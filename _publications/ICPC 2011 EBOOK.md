The International Crime Prevention Conference (ICPC) 2011 was organised by the National Crime Prevention Council from 14 to 17 November 2011 at the Suntec International Convention and Exhibition Centre. The conference theme "Building Resilient Societies. Forging Global Partnerships." set out to celebrate the spirit of community involvement that has enabled societies to stay resilient, and importantly, keep crime rates low. At the same time, the theme reflected the importance of international collaboration to counter crime in a globalised and increasingly cyber-connected world.
