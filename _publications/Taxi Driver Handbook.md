The Taxi Driver's Handbook was a joint collaboration between the National Crime Prevention Council and the Singapore Road Safety Council, with support from the Singapore Police Force, Land Transport Authority, National Taxi Association and sponsored by the General Insurance Association of Singapore and Caltex.

A total of 50,000 handbooks were produced and distributed to taxi drivers to educate them on crime prevention and road safety.
